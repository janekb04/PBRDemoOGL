# Rendering

My second OpenGL demo. It features efficient (near zero CPU cost) rendering with `glMultiDrawElementsIndirect` and features PBR shading. It uses compute shaders to shade instead of the traditional fragment shaders.

I made it in 2019 to learn PBR rendering, `glMultiDrawElementsIndirect` and in general OpenGL 4.6.
